# Mui:
A small tool to aid in file organization, written in Python 3. Default method of organizing is set to consolidate via file extension type. 
This means for each unique file extension type (e.g. .zip, .txt, .py, ect.) a folder will be created and appropriately matching files moved to said folder.
Simple, automated, and designed to run flawlessly across platforms. (Python required of course!)

Usage:  Clone or download (zip) this project, drag "mui.py" into the folder you would like to organize.
Finally, run it with Python3 and follow on-screen directions from there. (e.g. python3 .../mui.py)
